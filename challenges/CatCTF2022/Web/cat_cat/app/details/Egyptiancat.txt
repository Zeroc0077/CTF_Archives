The Egyptian cat is a medium short haired cat. Born at birth, weighing 2.5-7kg, with leopard like markings on the skin and coat color, the Egyptian cat is moderately shaped and muscular. The Egyptian cat is the only one among the spotted tiger spotted cats that does not breed artificially. It is a cat species that naturally forms dotted patterns and is known as the "small leopard". The dotted patterns on the body are randomly distributed in large or small sizes, and the face, limbs and tail have stripe patterns. There is a scarab pattern between the eyebrows on the forehead.
