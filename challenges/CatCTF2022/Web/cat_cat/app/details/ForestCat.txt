Norwegian forest cat, in a literal translation, is a cat that lives in Norwegian forests. It is a unique species of Scandinavian Peninsula. Its origin is unknown, and it often appears in the myth of northern Europe as a demon like cat. The appearance of Norwegian forest cat is similar to that of Maine cat, and it is in the same line as Siberian forest cat. The forest cat lives in a very cold and harsh environment, so it has a thicker coat and a stronger physique than other cats. The Norwegian forest cat is big and strong, runs very fast, and is not afraid of the sun and rain. When walking, its neck hair and tail hair are elegant and beautiful. However, the number of cats growing in the Norwegian forest interior has decreased year by year, and there is a crisis of extinction. Therefore, in the early 1970s, efforts to preserve and reproduce became particularly important.
